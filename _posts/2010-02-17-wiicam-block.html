<p><strong>A Tetris-fashioned proof-of-concept game for PC using a webcam and a wiimote as input devices, developed as part of university coursework. Coded in C#/XNA and C++ (OpenCV).</strong></p>
<p>This game relies on a webcamera and a Wii Remote controller (<em>wiimote</em>) to collect user input. The player interacts with the game holding the wiimote in her hand, moving and rotating the wiimote in front of the camera.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to align blocks of the same colour falling from the top, in a tetris-like fashion. The player can change the column by moving the wiimote horizontally and can spin the blocks by rotating the wiimote. The game also has a built in camera calibration procedure and testing that allow the player to calibrate the camera using a printed check board.</p>

<p>The main features of the application are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input is provided via the camera (wiimote position - not by the wiimote classic tracker) and wiimote accelerometer</li>
<li>Coded in C#/XNA for the game part and C++/OpenCV for the camera input</li>
<li>Built-in camera calibration and debugging</li>
<li>All the graphic content has been created by myself</li>
</ul>
