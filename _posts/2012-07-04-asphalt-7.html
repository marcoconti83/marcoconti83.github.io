<p>Released in June 2012, Asphalt 7 is a top class mobile racing game featuring state-of-the-art graphics, multiplayer and social networks integration. Having worked on this project for almost a year, I am credited as programmer.</p>
<p>With 60 cars available in the game and a 100-races long single player career, Asphalt 7 reached the first position on the top selling charts in a snap.</p>
<p>Available for <a title="Asphalt 7" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/asphalt-7-heat/id462694916?mt=8">iOS</a>Â and <a title="Asphalt 7" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA7HM&amp;hl=en">Android</a>.</p>
