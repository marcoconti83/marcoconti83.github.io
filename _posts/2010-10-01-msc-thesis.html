<p><strong>This MSc thesis for Trinity Collge Dublin implements building recognition on mobile devices (Android powered) using captured camera frames, without the need of a network connection to a remote server. A visual feature database used for recognition is stored in the device, requiring it be optimized to reduce the dimension. This optimization is obtained using clustering and genethic algorithms.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26" title="The concept" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/thesis-concept.png" alt="" width="450" height="258" /></strong></p>
<p>The research covers the design and development of a framework for the creation of small visual features database. This database is to be used on mobile devices to perform building recognition on a self-contained "Tell me what I am looking at" application using two inputs: GPS data and camera images.</p>
<p>The main contribution of this approach is exploring the automated creation of a compact local visual features database to be installed on the mobile device. Using a local database is justified by scenarios where a data connection to a remote server is not available or too expensive (e.g. tourists using data<br />
roaming abroad).</p>

<p>Creating a compact database requires a balance between various constraints. The number of visual features in the database will affects both the size of the database on the limited storage of a mobile platform and the computation time of the image matching. However, having a small number of features in the database also results in poor results. This research evaluates the use of a genetic algorithm that selects the best parameters to build the database using visual features clustering.</p>
