It is a one-man open source project developed in my free time in Java.</p>
<p>This new version supports Bezier curves and circles/ellipses.</p>
<p>The project (including the full source code and unit tests) can be found at theÂ <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/inkscapemap/">SourceForge Inkscapemap page</a>.</p>
