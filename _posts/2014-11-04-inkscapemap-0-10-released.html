It is a one-man open source project developed in my free time in Java.</p>
<p>I've just uploaded a new version supporting Bezier curves and circles/ellipses. Starting with this version 0.10, the license has been changed to the more permissive <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>.</p>
<p>The project (including the full source code and unit tests) can be found at theÂ <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/inkscapemap/">SourceForge Inkscapemap page</a>. Here are the the <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/inkscapemap">OpenHUB statistics</a>. Apparently, it's also featured in <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Others/Inkscape-Map.shtml">Softpedia</a>.</p>
